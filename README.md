# SPIlib 1.0 T (Testing)

**SPIlib** is a lightweight and powerful game development library designed to make it easy for developers to create 2D and 3D games. This version, **1.0 T (Testing)**, is intended for testing purposes and includes basic functions for game development, as well as support for 2D and 3D graphics, physics, collision detection, and basic multiplayer features.

## What's New in Version 1.0 T?

Version 1.0 T is focused on testing the core features of SPIlib and its interaction with the system. The following main features are included in this version:

- **2D and 3D Game Support**: Simple 2D platformers, 3D FPS, low-poly 3D, and voxel-based games.
- **Basic Physics and Collision Detection Support**: Basic gravity implementation and collision detection for objects.
- **Basic Multiplayer Support**: Support for simple TCP or UDP connections for multiplayer games (testing purposes).
- **Simple API for Game Development**: Minimalistic and efficient interface for fast game development.

## Testing

This release is intended for testing the basic functionality and performance of the library. Please report any bugs you encounter or provide feedback for improvements.

## Getting Started:

1. **Download SPIlib 1.0 T** from the website (or from GitHub).
2. **Installation**: Add the source file (`spilib.c`) to your project.
3. **Link the library**: Compile your project using `libspilib.a` or link `spilib.c` directly if you don't need static libraries.
4. **Run your game**: Now you're ready to start creating games using SPIlib!

## Example Projects:

- **Example 1: 2D Platformer**: A simple 2D game where the player moves a character across a platform, avoiding obstacles and collecting items.
- **Example 2: 3D FPS (Raycasting)**: A first-person shooter with basic raycasting for rendering the game world.

## Known Issues:

- Basic functionality, some features might be under development.
- Multiplayer features are not fully optimized and are mainly for testing.
